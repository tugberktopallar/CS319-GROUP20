1.1.	Architectural Styles
1.1.1.	 Layers
	In our system decomposition we decomposed our game logic into three layers.
  With this three layer system, all layers at the same level can depend on only
  layers which are one below of the current layer. We prefer three layers to provide
  maintability and flexibility to our program.
 	2.2.2 Model View Controller
	We classify subsystems into three parts, called model, view and controller. 
  We add a controller part between the domain knowledge and the user interface 
  and we are able to separate the domain knowledge from the user interface.  
  Here, the domain objects of our system is only accessed and controlled by 
  manager classes which are grouped under Game Driver layer.  Under this,
  main subsystems exist that interacts with both users and system. Below the 
  main subsystem layer, small subsystems are exist. They will be used for 
  providing features to the main subsystems. With the MVC system, we can 
  ensure that changes made on the interfaces will not affect the model of 
  the system, therefore it is a good idea to use MVC for our game.
